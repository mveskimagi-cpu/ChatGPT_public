The documented entry rule is satisfied: the completed 5-minute close of $165.455 was above the $162.81 trigger with 1.132x participation, and the latest quote ($165.405) remains above the trigger. SHOP is rank 3 with positive 5-day and 20-day momentum (+11.2% and +9.8%), above-baseline daily volume (1.296x), high dollar liquidity, and low selected-set correlation (0.114). The €100 allocation is within cash, buy, and position limits and retains substantial cash. Existing MSTR and HPE target alerts are not profit-taking signals because their recorded targets duplicate entry triggers; neither has documented invalidation. ON has not met its new breakout rule. Reduced sizing is warranted because SHOP volatility is elevated, the portfolio already holds three short-horizon momentum positions, and the regime is neutral/range with tight liquidity.",

The required two completed 15-minute closes above $65.76 were not verified.

Do not BUY: MSTR has deteriorated to rank 7 from 5, with sub-baseline daily volume (0.934x), elevated ATR (5.782%), and the portfolio is already about 55% allocated to clustered short-horizon long-equity momentum exposure in a tight-liquidity range regime.

It is consistent with the supplied current quote ($164.755), which is above both the documented $163.17 entry threshold and $156.85 invalidation level. The proposal correctly treats the $163.17 target alert as non-actionable because it duplicates the entry threshold. It does not invent a catalyst, take-profit, reversal, or new participation confirmation, and it appropriately rejects adding exposure amid rank deterioration, sub-baseline daily volume, high ATR, tight-liquidity/range conditions, and clustered long-equity momentum exposure. Missing MSTR completed-candle evidence prevents confirmation of intraday continuation or invalidation history, but does not make a HOLD invalid.",
          "checks": {
            "timestampFreshness": "PASS with limitation. MSTR quote/trigger data are contemporaneous on 2026-10-06 around 17:55Z. The cited macro regime is dated 2026-10-01 and therefore stale relative to the quote, but the proposal explicitly identifies it as stale and shadow-only rather than treating it as current execution-grade evidence.",
            "priceAndTriggerConsistency": "PASS. Supplied MSTR price is $164.755, above the $163.17 breakout threshold. The documented invalidation is one completed 5-minute close below $156.85; no such completed close is supplied.",
            "targetInterpretation": "PASS. MSTR's recorded target is \"Break above $163.17 with sustained participation,\" identical to its entry trigger. The proposal correctly declines to portray the target-level event as a valid profit-taking signal.",
            "arithmeticAndSizing": "PASS. MSTR value of approximately €150.31 is consistent with 1.02771459 shares at $164.755 and EURUSD 1.1265067. Total held-position value is approximately €552.72 (€202.30 + €150.31 + €100.49 + €99.62), or about 55.2% of €1,001.30 portfolio value. Cash plus position values is approximately €1,001.29, consistent with stated €1,001.30 after rounding. HOLD adds €0, so max-buy and max-position limits are not engaged.",
            "riskVeto": "PASS. Risk and hard-risk reports approve the no-change decision. No supplied veto requires a reduction or exit, and HOLD does not increase the already clustered long-equity exposure.",
            "thesisAndInvalidation": "PASS with limitation. The proposal preserves the documented $156.85 5-minute-close invalidation and does not relax it. Rank decline from 5 to 7, 0.934x daily volume, and 5.782% ATR reasonably support no-add. The proposal's statement that no reversal is supplied is supportable; it does not assert a reversal has been disproven.",
            "participation": "PASS for HOLD; insufficient for continuation/add. No current MSTR-specific completed 5-minute candle or participation ratio is provided. Therefore, the evidence cannot validate fresh upside participation, but the proposal explicitly uses that absence to avoid adding rather than to justify a trade.",

The target-level alert is not actionable because the recorded target duplicates the entry threshold rather than providing an independent profit-taking level. Do not BUY: MSTR has deteriorated to rank 7 from 5, with sub-baseline daily volume (0.934x), elevated ATR (5.782%), and the portfolio is already about 55% allocated to clustered short-horizon long-equity momentum exposure in a tight-liquidity range regime.
